# Install
Run
```bash
./install
```
That won't overwrite any existing dotfiles; you'll have to stash them manually before running it if you want to keep them.
Also run as `./install`

# Prompt
The Prompt file generates Prompts looking like:
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11:46:04
fsarubbi@frankss-mbp:~/workspace$ cd CorePlatform/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11:46:09
fsarubbi@frankss-mbp:~/workspace/CorePlatform[develop*]$ 
```

First prompt regular directory
Second prompt git Directory showing Branch name and if it is dirty
